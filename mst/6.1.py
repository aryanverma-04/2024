# Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging, also known as grammatical tagging or word-category disambiguation, is a process in natural language processing (NLP) where each word in a text is assigned a corresponding part-of-speech tag that indicates its grammatical category and syntactic role within a sentence. POS tagging is a fundamental task in NLP and is essential for many downstream tasks such as parsing, information extraction, and machine translation.

# Hidden Markov Model (HMM): HMM is a statistical model widely used in NLP tasks, including POS tagging. In the context of POS tagging, an HMM represents a sequence of observed words (tokens) and their corresponding hidden states (POS tags). The model assumes that the hidden states (POS tags) generate the observed words probabilistically, and the transition between hidden states follows a Markov process.

# Import the necessary modules from the NLTK library, including nltk itself, treebank from nltk.corpus, and the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) tagger from nltk.tag.
# Download the Penn Treebank dataset using the nltk.download() function, which contains tagged sentences for training the HMM tagger.
# Load the tagged sentences from the Penn Treebank dataset using treebank.tagged_sents(), which will be used for training and testing the HMM tagger.
# Split the tagged sentences into training and testing sets, with 80% of the data used for training and the remaining 20% for testing.
# Train the Hidden Markov Model tagger on the training data using hmm.HiddenMarkovModelTagger.train(train_data).
# Evaluate the performance of the trained HMM tagger on the test data, calculating the accuracy, and print the result. Then, tokenize a sample text using nltk.word_tokenize() and tag the tokens with their respective POS tags using the trained HMM model. Finally, display the POS tags for each token in the sample text.

# This Python code demonstrates the use of the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for part-of-speech (POS) tagging. It begins by downloading the Penn Treebank dataset, a corpus of tagged sentences commonly used for training NLP models. The code then splits the dataset into training and testing sets, with 80% of the data used for training the HMM tagger. Next, the HMM tagger is trained on the training data, and its performance is evaluated on the testing data to measure the accuracy of POS tagging. Finally, the code tokenizes a sample text and uses the trained HMM model to assign POS tags to each token, displaying the results to demonstrate the tagging process.
