# Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging, also known as grammatical tagging or word-category disambiguation, is a process in natural language processing (NLP) where each word in a text is assigned a corresponding part-of-speech tag that indicates its grammatical category and syntactic role within a sentence. POS tagging is a fundamental task in NLP and is essential for many downstream tasks such as parsing, information extraction, and machine translation.

# Hidden Markov Model (HMM): HMM is a statistical model widely used in NLP tasks, including POS tagging. In the context of POS tagging, an HMM represents a sequence of observed words (tokens) and their corresponding hidden states (POS tags). The model assumes that the hidden states (POS tags) generate the observed words probabilistically, and the transition between hidden states follows a Markov process.

# Import the spaCy library.
# Load the English language model provided by spaCy.
# Define a sample text to be analyzed.
# Process the text using the spaCy NLP pipeline to generate a Doc object.
# Iterate over each token in the Doc object.
# For each token, print its word, POS tag, and an explanation of the POS tag using spaCy's explain function.

# This code snippet utilizes the spaCy library to perform part-of-speech (POS) tagging on a given text.
# It first loads the English language model provided by spaCy and then processes the input text using the loaded model.
# For each word in the analyzed text, it prints the word itself, its corresponding POS tag, and an explanation of the POS tag using spaCy's explain function.
