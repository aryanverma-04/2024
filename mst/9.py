# Chunking in natural language processing (NLP) refers to the process of grouping words or tokens into meaningful chunks based on their grammatical structure and relationships. Chunking is typically performed after tokenization and part-of-speech (POS) tagging, and it helps extract higher-level information from text by identifying phrases or syntactic units.

# Syntactic chunking in spaCy refers to the process of identifying and extracting meaningful syntactic units or phrases from text using the syntactic structure provided by the spaCy library. In natural language processing (NLP), syntactic chunking, also known as shallow parsing, involves grouping words or tokens into higher-level structures based on their grammatical relationships and patterns. SpaCy offers robust capabilities for performing syntactic chunking as part of its linguistic analysis pipeline.

# At its core, syntactic chunking in spaCy leverages the linguistic annotations produced during the processing of text, which include tokenization, part-of-speech (POS) tagging, and dependency parsing. These annotations provide valuable information about the grammatical structure of sentences, enabling spaCy to identify and extract various types of syntactic units, such as noun phrases (NP), verb phrases (VP), prepositional phrases (PP), and more.


# Import the spaCy library, which provides natural language processing tools.
# Load the English language model ('en_core_web_sm') provided by spaCy using the spacy.load() function.
# Define a text string containing the input text to be analyzed.
# Process the input text using the loaded language model to create a Doc object, which represents the analyzed text with linguistic annotations.
# Iterate through each token in the Doc object and classify them into verb phrases, pronoun phrases, and noun phrases based on their part-of-speech (POS) tags and dependency labels.
# Print and store the tokens categorized as verb phrases, pronoun phrases, and noun phrases, respectively, for further analysis or processing.

# different linguistic categories, including verb phrases, pronoun phrases, and noun phrases.

# First, it loads the English language model ('en_core_web_sm') using spaCy's spacy.load() function. Then, it processes the input text using the loaded language model, creating a Doc object that represents the analyzed text with linguistic annotations.

# Next, it iterates through each token in the Doc object, extracting the part-of-speech (POS) tag for each token using the pos_ attribute. Based on the POS tags and dependency labels, the code categorizes tokens into verb phrases, pronoun phrases, and noun phrases using a series of conditional statements.

# During the iteration, tokens classified as nouns or proper nouns are printed and stored in the noun_phrases list. Similarly, tokens identified as pronouns are printed and stored in the pronoun_phrases list. Additionally, tokens categorized as verbs and not labeled as auxiliary verbs (using the dep_ attribute) are printed and stored in the verb_phrases list.

# Finally, the code prints the lists containing the extracted verb phrases, noun phrases, and pronoun
